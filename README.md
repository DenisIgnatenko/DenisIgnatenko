- 👋 Hey there! I'm Denis, a passionate Fullstack Web Developer with a knack for turning ideas into reality through code. My journey in the world of technology started from diverse experiences, ranging from spearheading IT projects at major companies to founding my own venture, Lobotryasi Coffee Roasters. With each step, I've honed my skills in web development, focusing on creating seamless user experiences and robust backend systems.

- 👨🏼‍💻As a Fullstack developer, I thrive on the challenge of bridging the gap between frontend and backend development. I'm proficient in a wide range of technologies, including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux for the frontend, and Node.js, PostgreSQL for the backend. My goal is not just to build functional websites but to craft elegant solutions that drive business success.

- 🚴🏽 I believe that effective web development goes beyond writing code—it's about understanding the needs of businesses and users alike. With my background in different industries, I bring a unique perspective to every project, ensuring that the solutions I deliver are not only technically sound but also aligned with broader business goals.

- 🏎️ Outside of coding, you'll find me exploring the world through the lens of my camera, capturing moments and sharing them with the world. This creative outlet fuels my passion for innovation and inspires me to push the boundaries of what's possible in web development.

- 🧡 I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Whether you're looking to build a cutting-edge web application or simply want to chat about the latest tech trends, feel free to reach out—I'd love to hear from you!
