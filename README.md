# 👋 Hi, I'm Denis — Backend Engineer with a Product Mindset

I'm a backend-focused software engineer with a foundation in fullstack development and a passion for building clean, scalable, and resilient systems. My experience ranges from early-stage startups to enterprise environments, where I've led development across the stack — from designing REST APIs and microservices to shipping production-ready UIs.

## 🛠️ Core Stack

- **Languages**: Java (Spring Boot), TypeScript (Node.js), JavaScript
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka
- **Frontend (when needed)**: React, Redux, TailwindCSS
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS (S3, EC2, RDS), GitHub Actions, CI/CD
- **Architecture**: Microservices, Event-Driven Systems, REST APIs

## 🔍 What I Focus On

- Designing backend services that are **robust**, **observable**, and **easy to extend**
- Writing code that follows **SOLID** principles and clean architecture
- Balancing speed of delivery with long-term maintainability
- Thinking not only as a developer, but as a **product engineer** — understanding business value behind the code

## 💼 Recent Work

- Built a production-grade **URL Shortener** microservice with Java + Spring Boot (Redis, PostgreSQL, Clean Architecture, Dockerized)
- Designed and maintained **Smart Mirror kiosk UI and backend APIs** (React + Node.js + AWS)
- Delivered backend modules for a **developer social network** — including notifications, achievements, and pub/sub messaging

## 🌍 A Bit More About Me

Originally from Moscow, I’m now based in Denmark, where I relocated with my family to pursue new professional challenges. Outside of tech, I’m a photographer, videographer, and weekend cyclist 🚴 — always curious, always learning.
